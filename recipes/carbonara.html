        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups rigatoni pasta</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh green peas</li>
            <li>¼ cup diced cooked ham</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Diresctions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>Remove bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings in pan; set bacon aside.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>    
            <p>Cook and stir garlic in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat. Add milk, cream cheese, and butter to skillet; stir until smooth.</p>
            <p>Stir Parmesan cheese, peas, ham, and bacon into cream cheese mixture; cook until peas are heated through, about 5 minutes more. Mix pasta into sauce to serve.</p>
